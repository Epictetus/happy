# Happy Ruby

**The Happy Web Application Toolkit for Ruby.**

## Introduction

Happy is a toolkit for developing web applications using Ruby. Inspired by both Sinatra and Rails, it sits somewhere in the middle, trying to offer the super-light-weight attitude and flexibility of Sinatra, the comfort and power of Rails, and adding a big chunk of extensibility and modularity that any lover of object-oriented application design will enjoy.

Furthermore, the way Happy handles incoming requests is vastly different from how most of the other frameworks do it, offering a new, extremely flexible and suspiciously fun way of building your application.

## Installing

Happy is available as a RubyGem, so just install it through `gem install happy` (or add it to your project's `Gemfile`. You know the drill.)

# Additional Information

## Current Status

Happy is being extracted from a web application that I've been working on. I'm trying to get a first, hopefully somewhat stable release out of the door some time during June 2012.

FWIW, here's a list of important things still missing right now:

* Better logging.
* Improved view engine compatibility.
